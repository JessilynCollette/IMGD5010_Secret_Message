# Goal / Inspiration
I was inspired to create layers of hidden meaning for this sketch. The goal of this project was to use noise and randomness in a meaningful way. Therefore I randomized agents to clutter the screen, only to be moved when the user discovers that the mouse can reveal more than what meets the eye. When I thought of noise, I thought of noise in images and that led me to tv static. I played around with the idea of tv static showing an actual picture underneath. Instead of an image underneath I landed on a message that can be interpreted differently by each viewer. I had initialy started with just shapes as the agents but went more technical, using 1's and 0's to cover the screen to go along with the more tehcnological aspect of it all. 

## Takeaway
This piece definitely evolved as I found out more possibilities in p5.js such as 'repelling' agents away from the mouse and 'erasing' pixels of an image to reveal what is underneath. Initially I was messing wit shapes and different optical illusions as background to the shapes. But this piece ended up being inspired as I experimented with different possibilities. Overall I feel as though it has accomplished the goal of using noise, agents, and randomness in a more meaningful way to guide the vewier towards interesting results.
